### The Server side

The server of Nuxt.js is powered by [Nitro](https://nitro.unjs.io/), which is an excellent alternative to express.js.

Currently, I am working on the backend development with [Kotlin + Spring Boot](https://github.com/Chilfish/chilpost-sb/), so this part may be delayed.

> [!WARNING]
> The server side is not ready yet, so the api part is not available.
